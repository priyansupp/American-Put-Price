# The Calculation of the American Put Option Price from the Stock Prediction




## Aim of the project :- 
The models (LSTM, GBM and SARIMAX) have been used to determine
the Stock prices separately. Then their weighted values have been summed up to
get an aggregate of the Stock price. Finally that value of the stock price has been
used for calculating the Option Price.

## Data :- 
The ORACLE Corporation NYSE data has been extracted from the Yfinance.
